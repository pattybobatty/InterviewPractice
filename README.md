The project Calculator has a scene called BasicCalculator and renders a working calculator.
Basic functionality has been verified, exhaustive tests have not been done and there are known bugs in the float math.  

The project IntersectEqs contains the rect rect distance problem as well as solutions to a number of other tests,
such as capsule sphere overlap, sphere sphere overlap and closest point on line segment etc. 
The scene MultiTest contains all of the tests and runs them simultaneosly.
The objects can be moved in the scene view in real time and will dynamically display the results.  

These were all built in Unity 2018.0.f2, for compatiblities sake.
